# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
print("Sum of a and b: ", a+b)

# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number for division: "))
print("Remainder of a divided by b is ", a%b)

# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input() function.

a = "hello"
print(type(a))

# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether a given variable a is greater than 'b' or not. Take a 34 and b = 80

a = 34
b = 80
print(f"{a} greater than {b}: {a > b}")


# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user. 

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = (a + b)/2

print("Averaye of a and b: ", c)


# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

a = int(input("Enter number: "))
print(f"Square of {a} is: ", a**2)
