# 🐍 Python Practice
Hey there! I’m Anurag Devnath — I break things, fix them, and sometimes accidentally make something cool in the process.

This repo is where I mess around with Python. You’ll find small projects, random ideas, and lots of trial-and-error code. Nothing fancy — just me learning, building, and sometimes yelling at the terminal.

It’s not perfect. It’s not pretty. But it’s real.
Check it out if you're curious — or bored. That works too.
